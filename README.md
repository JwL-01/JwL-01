Hello! My name is Jacky and I am a student at Simon Fraser University pursuing a Computer Science degree. My passion for gaming has led to an exciting role at Offworld Industries, the developers behind the popular game Squad, where I had the opportunity to contribute as a co-op programmer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first-person shooter game!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning X86-64 Assembly.

I'm excited about connecting with fellow professionals who share my passion for gaming and technology, and I look forward to discovering new possibilities and forming meaningful connections. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
